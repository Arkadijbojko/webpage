My research field is enumerative algebraic geometry where I have mainly focused on sheaf-counting theories thus far. Through my work, I help to advance our understanding of invariants and structures of moduli spaces of sheaves by using tools from representation theory, combinatorics, topology, gauge theory, and derived algebraic geometry. The techniques I often apply rely on the wall-crossing behaviour of sheaves under changing stability conditions and on equivariant localization. Much of my work is oriented towards sheaf-counting on Calabi-Yau fourfolds and towards Virasoro constraints for abelian categories. Here, I used vertex algebras and their formal families combined with wall-crossing to prove multiple existing conjectures. 

**I am (co)organizing** the [Algebraic Geometry Seminar](https://wiki.preschema.com/ag-seminar) at Academia Sinica. You can contact me using the email address found [here](https://www.math.sinica.edu.tw/f59addca-1da6-47fd-9bb8-18d087da6088/pages/20#).
