My research field is _enumerative algebraic geometry_ where I have mainly focused on _sheaf-counting theories_ thus far. Through my work, I help to advance our understanding of invariants and structures of moduli spaces of sheaves by using tools from representation theory, derived algebraic geometry topology, combinatorics, and gauge theory. The techniques I often apply rely on the wall-crossing behaviour of sheaves under changing stability conditions and on equivariant localization. Two main areas that I dedicated most of my time to are _sheaf-counting on Calabi-Yau fourfolds_ and _Virasoo constraints for linear categories_. Here, I used vertex algebras and their formal families combined with wall-crossing to prove multiple existing conjectures. Coming back to my roots, I am beginning to dabble in various topics of _mathematical physics_.
