My research field is enumerative algebraic geometry where I have mainly focused on sheaf-counting theories thus far. Through my work, I help to advance our understanding of invariants and structures of moduli spaces of sheaves by using tools from representation theory, combinatorics, topology, gauge theory, and derived algebraic geometry. The techniques I often apply rely on the wall-crossing behaviour of sheaves under changing stability conditions and on equivariant localization. Much of my work is oriented towards sheaf-counting on Calabi-Yau fourfolds and towards Virasoro constraints for abelian categories. Here, I used vertex algebras and their formal families combined with wall-crossing to prove multiple existing conjectures.
