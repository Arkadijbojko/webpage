# Enumerative Seminar <br>
### Tuesdays at 2pm

**Quantum cohomology/quantum K rings and cluster algebras**<br>
I will introduce a relation between the quantum cohomology ring/quantum K ring of a quiver variety and the cluster algebra. More explicitly, given a quiver with potential, there is an injective ring homomorphism from the cluster algebra to quantum cohomology/quantum K ring of the corresponding quiver variety. This relation has been proved for A and D type quivers.
