**Elliptic Constructions via DAG**<br>
I'll talk about some recent work with Adeel Khan in which we construct elliptic versions of loop spaces from derived algebraic geometry. I'll explain the construction, which passes through a Tannakian formalism, and sketch the resulting equivariant elliptic cohomology theory. Time permitting I will explain some expected applications to geometric representation theory.
