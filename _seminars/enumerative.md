**Stable envelope for critical loci**<br>
In this talk, we will introduce a generalization of Maulik-Okounkov’s stable envelopes to equivariant critical cohomology. In the case of a tripled quiver variety with standard cubic potential, this reduces to MO’s stable envelope for the Nakajima variety of the corresponding doubled quiver along the dimensional reduction. We define non-abelian stable envelopes for quivers with potentials following a similar construction of Aganagic-Okounkov, and use them to relate critical COHAs to the abelian stable envelopes. Explicit computations are given in three examples: 1) Verma modules and higher spin representations of the Yangian of sl(2); 2) oscillator representations of the shifted Yangian of sl(2); 3) fundamental representation of the Yangian of sl(2|1). This talk is based on joint work in progress with Yalong Cao, Andrei Okounkov, and Zijun Zhou.

**Exceptional surfaces in 3-folds and derived symmetries** [Video](https://youtu.be/4q1dbNOgHS4?si=emQiKrCm3KZ4WBcA)<br> 
Crepant resolutions of 3-fold singularities may contain elaborate configurations of exceptional surfaces. Using toric cases as a guide, I review some known contributions of these configurations to the derived autoequivalence group of the resolution, particularly from the work of Seidel-Thomas, and discuss work in progress with Luyu Zheng.

**Quantum cohomology/quantum K rings and cluster algebras**<br>
I will introduce a relation between the quantum cohomology ring/quantum K ring of a quiver variety and the cluster algebra. More explicitly, given a quiver with potential, there is an injective ring homomorphism from the cluster algebra to quantum cohomology/quantum K ring of the corresponding quiver variety. This relation has been proved for A and D type quivers.
