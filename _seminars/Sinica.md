Title: Permutation equivariant quantum K-theory of a point

Abstract: In the first part, I will provide motivation for developing a K-theoretic version of Witten-Kontsevich theory. Then I will review known results about computations of (permutation equivariant) quantum K-theory of a point.
In the second part, I will explain a new approach to these computations. The approach involves a recursive pushforward technique applied to the universal cotangent line bundle and pluri-Hodge bundle. This technique is combinatorially simpler for not using the Kawasaki-Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem. As a result, we obtain a closed formula on genus 1. This is a joint work with Y.-P. Lee.
