Following our success in [pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ekkn5Lcu485OYkHykkR_q_ccffgaNPPS/view?usp=sharing) where I, W. Lim, and M. Moreira proved Virasoro constraints for moduli schemes of sheaves on curves and surfaces, I continue studying further settings where they may be present. The idea is to compare the constraints to the virtual fundamental class being a physical state of a geometrically constructed vertex algebra. This vertex algebra was introduced by Joyce to describe wall-crossing of sheaf-counting invariants. Consequently, Virasoro constraints are preserved by wall-crossing under changing stability conditions which can be also used to prove them for (framed) representations of quivers with relations as I do in my [more recent work](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WmblMu2jqqxyMCw7uD4h58lmneMoDywX/view?usp=sharing). A particularly enticing outcome of this work is the proof of sheaf-theoretic Virasoro constraints for $\mathbb{P}^2$ and $\mathbb{P}^1\times \mathbb{P}^1$ which are the main stepping stones to an independent proof for any surface due to an existing universality argument. This answers one of the fundamental questions of the subject - sheaf-theoretic Virasoro constraints for surfaces can be proved independently of GW theory.
